# VBA-challenge
This project was an assignment giving to me in my Georgia Tech Data science bootcamp.
We asked to use VBA scripting to analyze stock market data from 2018 to 2020.
We had to loop through each yearâ€™s worksheets and calculated the yearly changes of the stocks' opening and closing prices, the stocks' yearly percent changes, and the stocks' total volume.
This project helped me to get familiar with VBA coding
